              (AML) policy applies to the Company and all of its staff who
              provide services which might be used to conceal or disguise the
              true origins of criminally derived proceeds with the intention to

              Terrorism Regulations of 2003, it is the policy of this Company to
              undertake a risk assessment, and ensure that evidence of
              customer’s identity is obtained and retained as appropriate for
              all clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to the nature of the online gaming business, the Company
              conducts an enhanced due diligence process for all of its
              prospective customers.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Company’s KYC procedures will require prospective customers to
              create a full profile at point of registration.
            </li>
            <li>
              This evidence will be obtained before the customer can access the
              online games. In case that the customer is a Politically Exposed
              Person (PEP), the customer is considered as high risk and further
              due diligence procedures is performed at the Company’s discretion.
              In addition to completing the registration form, the Company may
              carry out additional verification procedures (such as an ID card
              or driving license) for any payout. If necessary, the Company will
              do a phone verification exercise, which will involve calling the
              number the user has stated and verify the information provided by
              the player.

            <li>
              7.5. Internal control procedures have been designed to comply with
              the regulations. Internal controls take the form of manual
              controls implemented on a daily basis by Company’s Operations Team
              (and/or Payments Team) and computer/automated controls inherent
              within the gaming system software.
            </li>
            <li>
              The gaming system has inbuilt internal control tools which based
              on the information inputted by the prospective customers can
              trigger red flags about suspicious activity to the Operations
              Team. Refer to some examples below:

                  prospective customer is unique in the customer database
                  preventing the possibility of a player having multiple
                  accounts. If a player tries to open more than one account, for
                  whatever reason, the Company reserves the right to block or
                  close any or all of the player’s accounts at its discretion;

                  participate in any game only if the player has sufficient
                  funds on his/her Member Account for such participation. It is
                  the Company’s policy not to accept cash and not to give any
                  credit whatsoever for participation in any game;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Withdrawal is only allowed if the name of person requesting
                  the withdrawal is the same name of person holding the account.
                  Under no circumstances shall the Company affect a payout to a
                  player in a name other than in the name of the player.

            <li>
              Internal controls are not entirely computer dependent. The
